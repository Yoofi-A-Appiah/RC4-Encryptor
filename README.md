SecureScrolls API
Project Overview

As part of my group work in Data&Network security, we were tasked to implement and algorithm in file encryption and decryption. SecureScrolls API is the back-end service for the SecureScrolls file encryption application. It handles file encryption and decryption operations using the RC4 algorithm and provides endpoints for communication with the UI.
Features

    RESTful API endpoints for file encryption and decryption.
    Integration with the RC4 encryption algorithm.
    Secure handling of user authentication and authorization.
    Error handling and logging for robustness.
